Inference Gateway Objective - Status

DONE
- [x] FastAPI server boots and serves HTTP.
- [x] Health endpoint exists: GET /healthz.
- [x] Request ID middleware exists:
  - reads X-Request-ID if present
  - generates UUID if missing
  - stores request.state.request_id
  - sets response header X-Request-ID
- [x] Request-id handling standardized to X-Request-ID only (by design).
- [x] Chat request schema exists with OpenAI-like fields:
  - model
  - messages[{role, content}]
  - stream (bool)
- [x] Route path exists as POST /v1/chat/completions.
- [x] Settings class exists and is used in main app (root_path, api_title, request_id_header, backend_url, port).
- [x] `backend_url` is configured in settings and forwarding is implemented via LlamaCppBackend.
- [x] In handler, extract last user message content as prompt (both EchoBackend and LlamaCppBackend use messages[-1].content).
- [x] Backend forwarding flow via LlamaCppBackend: POSTs to backend_url/v1/chat/completions.
- [x] Fallback echo flow: EchoBackend replies with "Echo: <prompt>" and is the factory default.
- [x] Non-stream JSON response shape returned:
  - id (uuid)
  - choices: [{ "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": "<reply>" }, "finish_reason": "stop" }]
  - usage: { "prompt_tokens", "completion_tokens", "total_tokens" } (hardcoded 0s for now)
- [x] Server port configurable by env (PORT) with default 8000.
  (Settings.port, main.py __main__ block, Dockerfile CMD uses python -m gateway.main, Makefile/env files pass PORT.)
- [x] `gateway.security` module exists with `verify_token` and `Depends` (imported in main.py for future use).

OPTIONAL / STRETCH
- [ ] stream=true support with SSE:
  - proxy backend SSE if backend supports it
  - else emit one SSE chunk with full reply then data: [DONE]
  (Route dispatches to stream_chat but it returns a Response object, not actual SSE events.)
- [ ] Optional GET /v1/models endpoint.

CLEANUP / TECH-DEBT
- [ ] Confirm env file path strategy (`/gateway/envs/.env`) works in container/runtime.
  (Config hardcodes /gateway/envs/.env but Dockerfile WORKDIR is /app; no .env is copied there. Runtime relies on --env-file flag instead.)
- [ ] Add basic tests for:
  - request-id middleware behavior
  - /v1/chat/completions non-stream response shape
  - echo fallback path
